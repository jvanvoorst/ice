	<p class="welcome-body row">Have you ever been told you should leave your route info with a responsible person in case you are overdue? Ice is that responsible person. Once you have registered all you will need to do is add people to alert when you are overdue, and then setup alerts with info about the trail-head, your route, your vehicle, and the time you expect to be back. Ice will send a text to your phone when you create an alert and one hour before your alert time. To cancel the alert all you need to do is respond to either one of these texts with the message: "safe". Once the alert time is reached and you have not cancelled the alert Ice will send text messages to all people that you have chosen to alert with your details.</p>
