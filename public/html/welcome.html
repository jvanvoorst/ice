	<p class="welcome-body row">When we go on adventures in the backcountry we all know we should leave our route information with a responsible person in case something happens and we donâ€™t make it back on time. <i>Ice</i> is that responsible person. Once you have registered you simply add people who will receive alerts, and then setup these alerts with information about the trail-head, your route, your vehicle, and the time you expect to be back. <i>Ice</i> will send a text to your phone when you create an alert and another text one hour before your return time. Once your return time is reached and you have not cancelled the alert <i>Ice</i> will send text messages to all of your chosen people along with the details you have provided.</p>
